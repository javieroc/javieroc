# Hi there! üëã I'm Javier, a Full Stack Developer

## üöÄ About Me

I'm a **passionate Full Stack Developer** with a love for building scalable, high-performance applications. My journey into coding began with curiosity, and it has transformed into a deep enthusiasm for problem-solving, innovation, and continuous learning.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably discussing tech trends, contributing to the developer community, or watching great movies (you can see some of my favorite quotes below!).

## üå± What I'm Currently Working On

I'm currently building **Workahomie**! It's an app designed to connect professionals and people with shared occupations who want to work together for a day. Think of it as a Couchsurfing for workspaces, where users can host others in their homes to share a productive day.
